# User-Interface

12/18 - Simply Populating Pages, and laying out.
        Goal to get everything where it needs to be, then polish.
      - Added the About, made this site work for both tablet and desktop screens.
        Cleaned Code, made it more legible, next I need to review their names and see, make sure they are clear.
      - Things to Figure Out & Do:
            1) [ ] How Do You add the rating stars?
            2) [x] How Do YOu add the search bar?
            3) [ ] How will I build the Hamburger Menu for mobile?
            4) [ ] I need to add Team Photos and Names to The About page.
            5) [ ] I need to Create the Mobile Layout.
            5) [x] Tweak the tablet layout on the home page, so that the banner         spans 100% when the container is bellow the containers max           possible size.
            6) [ ] Design a Title Bar Log
                     a) use it for the Nav bar as a Home Button as-well.
            7) [ ] Edit the Banner Photo, make it relate more to a restuarant.
            8) [ ] Make the Galleries react on hover.
                     a) Current Idea is to pop up a hidden div, telling each team members favorite resturant.

12/19 - Slow Day, just read up on how to create search bars, menus and what not
        a) Tomorrow I'll hopefully complete those elements

12/20 - Added the search bar, just need to work on the styling.
      - Tablet banner change, the rest looks to fit just fine, done so by changing the  containerAttr (removed tablet @media, website scales better without a defined step for it)
      - Mobile Layout Just needs to have a nav menu created.
      - Created a Hamburger Menu using only CSS animations, will populate the screen with an overlay and access to all the nav bar options, this will only apear on mobile devices, tablet and desktop have the default nav bar ontop.
