# User-Interface

12/18 - Simply Populating Pages, and laying out.
        Goal to get everything where it needs to be, then polish.
      - Added the About, made this site work for both tablet and desktop screens.
        Cleaned Code, made it more legible, next I need to review their names and see, make sure they are clear.
      - Things to Figure Out & Do:
            1) [x] How Do You add the rating stars?
            2) [x] How Do YOu add the search bar?
            3) [x] How will I build the Hamburger Menu for mobile?
            4) [x] I need to add Team Photos and Names to The About page.
            5) [x] I need to Create the Mobile Layout.
            5) [x] Tweak the tablet layout on the home page, so that the banner         spans 100% when the container is bellow the containers max           possible size.
            6) [x] Design a Title Bar Log --made title a href
                     a) use it for the Nav bar as a Home Button as-well.
            7) [x] Edit the Banner Photo, make it relate more to a restuarant.
            8) [x] Make the Galleries react on hover.
                     a) Current Idea is to pop up a hidden div, telling each team members favorite resturant.

12/19 - Slow Day, just read up on how to create search bars, menus and what not
        a) Tomorrow I'll hopefully complete those elements

12/20 - Added the search bar, just need to work on the styling.
      - Tablet banner change, the rest looks to fit just fine, done so by changing the  containerAttr (removed tablet @media, website scales better without a defined step for it)
      - Mobile Layout Just needs to have a nav menu created.
      - Created a Hamburger Menu using only CSS animations, will populate the screen with an overlay and access to all the nav bar options, this will only apear on mobile devices, tablet and desktop have the default nav bar ontop.
      -Tweaked Tablet sizing for gallery on about page.
      -Added a stars to the ratings that react on hover.

12/29 -Tweaked the quick links bellow the banner, at first I made the images
       static with photoshop, then relized all I had to do was create a parent dive
       to contain the image vector, and it would be simplter and can be easily changed
       down the line.
      - Added photos to about page.
        - Some still need to send me one.... including myself
        - Some need a quick tweak in PS to make the size fit
        - Some may want to change what they have.

1/5   - Changed the About Page, now it's layout is better suited for a 
        mobile layout. Now utilizes more width.
      - All I have left to do is edit the team photos.

1/9   - Added  Final photos
      - fixed mobile over lap in about page
      - added Sign in links and Join
