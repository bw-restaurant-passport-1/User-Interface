# User-Interface

12/18 - Simply Populating Pages, and laying out.
        Goal to get everything where it needs to be, then polish.
      - Added the About, made this site work for both tablet and desktop screens.
        Cleaned Code, made it more legible, next I need to review their names and see, make sure they are clear.
      - Things to Figure Out & Do:
            1) [ ] How Do You add the rating stars?
            2) [ ] How Do YOu add the search bar?
            3) [ ] How will I build the Hamburger Menu for mobile?
            4) [ ] I need to add Team Photos and Names to The About page.
            5) [ ] I need to Create the Mobile Layout.
            5) [ ] Tweak the tablet layout on the home page, so that the banner         spans 100% when the container is bellow the containers max           possible size.
            6) [ ] Design a Title Bar Log
                     a) use it for the Nav bar as a Home Button as-well.
            7) [ ] Edit the Banner Photo, make it relate more to a restuarant.
            8) [ ] Make the Galleries react on hover.
                     a) Current Idea is to pop up a hidden div, telling each team members favorite resturant.

12/19 - Slow Day, just read up on how to create search bars, menus and what not
        a) Tomorrow I'll hopefully complete those elements
