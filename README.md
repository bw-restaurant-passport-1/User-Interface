# User-Interface

12/18 - Simply Populating Pages, and laying out.
        Goal to get everything where it needs to be, then polish.
      - Added the About, made this site work for both tablet and desktop screens.
        Cleaned Code, made it more legible, next I need to review their names and see, make sure they are clear.
